Certainly! Here are the similar steps described in both parts, rephrased:

1. Create a new repository and include a README file.
2. Launch Visual Studio and ensure it is up to date.
3. Clone the repository and navigate to its location on your PC, preferably on the desktop for easy access.
4. Install Git and the C# extension in Visual Studio.
5. Create a ".gitignore" file and add "bin" and "obj" folders to it to exclude them from version control.
6. Execute the command "dotnet new webapp -o [project name] --framework net5.0" to generate a web application template.
7. Customize the "Index.cshtml" file under the "Pages" folder by modifying the theme name, welcome message, and time.
8. Create a "Models" folder under the "Pages" folder to organize the project structure.
9. Inside the "Models" folder, create a "journalism1.cs" file.
10. Copy and paste the code from the course materials, specifically from the third week, into the "journalism1.cs" file.
11. Run the command "dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator razorpage -m journalism1 -dc journalismContext -udl -outDir Pages/journalism1 --referenceScriptLibraries -sqlite" to generate Razor Pages and scaffolding based on the "journalism1" model.
12. Customize the generated code by replacing occurrences of "movies" with "journalism1" in appropriate places.
13. Run the two commands simultaneously: "dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate" and "dotnet ef database update" to create and update the database schema.
14. Create a "SeedData.cs" file and copy relevant information from week 4 materials into it.
15. Modify the "SeedData.cs" file to include properties for six journalism articles.
16. Copy the final data from the week 4 materials and paste it into the "Program.cs" file, ensuring to rename it accordingly.
17. Add a new button to the "Layout.cshtml" file under "Pages > Shared" to enhance the website's functionality.
18. Execute the command "dotnet run" to build and run the project.
19. If you encounter a "Project not found" error, navigate to the project folder, copy its name, use the "cd" command followed by pasting the name, and then run the command again.
20. When you click on the local browser address provided by the project, it should open the website in the browser, allowing you to verify that it is operational..
